Create a To-Do List Application (Console-based)

**Code Used:**

This Python script implements a simple To-Do list application with the following functions:

- `load_tasks()`: Reads tasks from a file named `todo.txt`.
- `save_tasks(tasks)`: Writes the current list of tasks to the `todo.txt` file.
- `add_task(tasks, task)`: Adds a new task to the list and saves the updated list.
- `remove_task(tasks, task_index)`: Removes a task at a specified index from the list and saves the updated list.
- `view_tasks(tasks)`: Displays the current list of tasks.
- `todo()`: The main function that provides a menu-driven interface for interacting with the To-Do list.

**Data Used:**

The application uses a text file named `todo.txt` to store the tasks. This file is created and managed by the Python script. Based on the execution output, the following tasks were added to the `todo.txt` file.

**Output:**

The output shows the interaction with the To-Do list application through the console. It demonstrates adding tasks, viewing the list, and removing tasks. The output includes the prompts for user input and messages confirming actions like adding or removing tasks, as well as the display of the To-Do list at various stages.
